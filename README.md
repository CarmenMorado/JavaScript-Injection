# JavaScript-Injection
100 Days of Swift (Project 19) A Safari extension which lets one embed a version of the app directly inside Safari's action menu, then manipulate Safari data in 
interesting ways. Throughout this project, I learned about extensions, NSExtensionItem, JavaScript, UITextView, NotificationCenter, and more. 

In addition, I completed the following (part 3) challenges:
-Add a bar button item that lets users select from a handful of prewritten example scripts, shown using a UIAlertController â€“ at the very least your list should 
include the example we used in this project.
-You're already receiving the URL of the site the user is on, so use UserDefaults to save the user's JavaScript for each site. You should convert the URL to a URL
object in order to use its host property.
-For something bigger, let users name their scripts, then select one to load using a UITableView.
